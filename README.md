# PayShieldPPressureTest
This repository contains a set of simple Python scripts to create a workload on the Thales appliance payShield 10k.
They can be useful during demonstrations of the appliance.
They are in an early development stage and still a bit clumsy.
To use them you need to edit the IP of the appliance and the HOST port.
When I will have time, and learn better Python I will create a version that accepts parameters ;-)
